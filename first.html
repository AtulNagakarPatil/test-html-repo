    <p> <b>A computer is a machine that can store and process informetion. Most computers
            rely on a binary system,which use two variables,0 to 1 to complete tasks such as
            storing data,calculating algorithms and displaying information. Computers come in many
            different shapes and size,from handheld smartphone to supercomputer weighing more
            than 300 tons.</b><i>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any
            information can be numerically encoded, people soon realoized that computers are capable
            pf general-purpose information processing. Their capacity to handle large amounts of data
            has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting. Their speed has allowed them
            to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and</i>
        to control mechanical systems such as automobails, nuclear reactores and robotic surgical
        tools.They are also cheap enough to br embedded in everyday appliances and to
        make clothes dryers and rice cookers "smart."<u> Computers have allowed us to pose and answer question that
            could not be pursued before.
            These question might be about DNA sequences in genes,patterns of activity in a consumer market,or all the
            uses of
            a word in texts that have been stored in a database. Increasingly,computers can also learn
            and adapt as they operate</u>
