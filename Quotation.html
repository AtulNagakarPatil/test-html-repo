            The cat, also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. It is the only
            domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of
            the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
